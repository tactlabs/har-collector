It also has a 4wheel-drive system with electronic control over the way torque is distributed among the four wheels. And thanks to the use of aluminum in key locations, it's about 90 pounds lighter than the 996 Turbo. Aluminum doors alone save 31 pounds. The Turbo benefits from the more communicative steering integral to every 997-based model. Coupled with the 4-Wheel Drive system that's integrated with the PSM, you can hang the tail out with the best of the Porsche crazies and still rely on the stability-control system to save you from your worst excesses. If you do choose to turn the PSM off, the system doesn't automatically come back on under braking as it did before. It only does so when you brake hard enough to engage the ABS. Around the famous Ring, the 997 Turbo is more than 10 seconds faster than a Carrera S, putting its time in the 7:50 range. WE WELCOME YOUR TRADE at the highest value. SAME DAY, EASY APPROVALS. FINANCING and LEASING options on most vehicles, as well as extended warranties, and aftermarket services. We are connected to all banks and leasing companies - all at the lowest rates and payments.

The second version of the 997 made some significant departures from the original 997 including a new direct fuel injected engine (9A1) a dual clutch PDK transmission, revised suspension and the all-important from bumper with LED lights. The 997.2 is probably the first time since the air-cooled cars, that Porsche actually got the 911 in the solid reliable spot it needed to be in. This Targa comes in a Carrera White Exterior Color with Black Interior color.  The Targa 4 S featured a cabin better organized than its coupe sibling, due to the rear opening windscreen. That allowed an increase for the storage compartment behind the rear seats. With the Back seats folded, the result was a storage compartment larger and more convenient than the trunk itself.
